# Pewlett_Hackard-Analysis

Bobby was given the assignment to find the number of retirees that are likely to retire in the coming years. We created varoius data sets to capture different departments, salaries, genders, and job titles of positions that would like need to be replaced/filled.

# Results
-Number of retirees: 41,380
-Number of available mentees: 14,038

Finally, we can conclude that indeed because of the large group of retirees there may be a staffing challenge. The mentees will be availabke to positioned into promotion roles, although PH will need to continue efforts towards recruitement and hiring.
